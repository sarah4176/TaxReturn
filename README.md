# TaxReturn
I created this project with the supervision of my industry supervisor. Front-end was done entirely by me and the back-end was done with the help of my supevisor's instructions.
I developed a software during my Internship, but due to security issues I am not able to share the source code, but here are the pictures of web pages of the developed web application.
The applications has two sides, Client and Branch.
I used .NET CORE to built this web application, I used JS, bootstrap, CSS for the features and project requirements.
Branch side starts from Login page.
